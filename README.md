## set up instructions

### secrets file
- duplicate `secrets_example.json` + rename `secrets.json`
- copy and paste OpenAI key in `secrets.json`

### running the pipeline
- open `final_pipeline.ipynb`
- run the first few cells until you see this:

change the classification to your desired category (_animals, art, cities, clinical_). 
- **do not run the "create dataset" or "token and create DistilBERT embeddings" sections.** scroll until you see this:

- run the rest of the notebook and everything should proceed smoothly!

### dataset
- the final dataset is located in `data/final_data.csv`

(if you download the whole repo, it should be automatically detected when running `final_pipeline.ipynb`)

## repo structure
the main files you will need to run our final code are described above. a brief summary of the repo structure is included below:
- `data/`: this folder contains the various files we used to construct our final dataset, as well as other datasets we experimented with while developing our methodology
- `img/`: this folder contains figures generated by our code to show the results of different experiments
- `outputs/`: this folder contains files with the textual output from running our code (e.g., llm outputs, statistics, etc.)
- `new-method-exp`: this folder contains files with earlier experiments/iterations of our final methodology
- `old-method-exp`: this folder contains files with the experiments/code needed to run our intial methodology (see Sec. 3 of our paper)
