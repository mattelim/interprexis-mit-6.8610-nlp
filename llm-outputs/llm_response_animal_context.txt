	•			Axis 1 (Confidence: 60%): Possibly captures domestication or familiarity. Cats and dogs have more negative values, suggesting a closer association with humans compared to sheep, horses, and birds.
	•			Axis 2 (Confidence: 50%): May represent size or physical attributes. The values are small and vary slightly, indicating a less distinct characteristic.
	•			Axis 3 (Confidence: 80%): Likely represents freedom or the ability to fly. The notably more negative value for 'Bird' supports this inference.
	•			Axis 4 (Confidence: 60%): Could be related to habitat or environmental adaptation. All values are negative but vary in magnitude.
	•			Axis 5 (Confidence: 70%): Seems to capture mobility or agility, especially with 'Bird' having a distinctly higher positive value.
	•			Axis 6 (Confidence: 65%): Potentially related to social behavior or domestication level, as all values are positive but vary among different animals.
	•			Axis 7 (Confidence: 55%): Might represent intelligence or trainability. The values are mostly positive but vary, indicating different levels among these animals.
	•			Axis 8 (Confidence: 50%): Could be associated with physical characteristics like size or color, given the positive but lower values.
	•			Axis 9 (Confidence: 40%): Represents a less clear trait, possibly an abstract or inconsistent characteristic due to the mix of negative and positive values.
	•			Axis 10 (Confidence: 60%): Likely related to the animal's utility or role in human society, as indicated by mostly negative values.
