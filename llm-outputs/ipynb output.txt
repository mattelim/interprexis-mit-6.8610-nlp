  "content": "There are 7 dimensions.\n\nRow 1: Physical characteristics. The first list contains objects that can be observed in the physical world, such as \"person,\" \"bicycle,\" \"car,\" etc. The embedding values for this row likely encode physical characteristics or features of these objects.\n\nRow 2: Size. The second list contains embedding values that differ based on the size or scale of the objects. Objects with larger sizes have higher values, such as \"truck,\" \"boat,\" and \"elephant,\" while smaller objects have lower values, such as \"bird,\" \"cat,\" and \"banana.\"\n\nRow 3: Vertical position. The third list represents the vertical position of the objects. Objects that are higher up or elevated have positive values, such as \"airplane,\" \"bird,\" and \"kite,\" while objects closer to the ground have negative values, such as \"car,\" \"dog,\" and \"fork.\"\n\nRow 4: Horizontal position. The fourth list encodes the horizontal position of the objects. Objects that are more to the left have negative values, such as \"person,\" \"bicycle,\" and \"car,\" while objects that are more to the right have positive values, such as \"bench,\" \"cat,\" and \"cup.\"\n\nRow 5: Roundness. The fifth list represents the roundness or circularity of the objects. Objects with more round or curved shapes have positive values, such as \"traffic light,\" \"stop sign,\" and \"wheel,\" while objects with more angular or straight shapes have negative values, such as \"bench,\" \"knife,\" and \"book.\"\n\nRow 6: Emotional connotation. The sixth list captures the emotional connotation associated with the objects. Objects with more positive emotions have positive values, such as \"flower,\" \"gift,\" and \"sun,\" while objects with more negative emotions have negative values, such as \"spider,\" \"wasp,\" and \"gun.\"\n\nRow 7: Natural vs. man-made. The seventh list distinguishes between natural and man-made objects. Natural objects have negative values, such as \"bird,\" \"tree,\" and \"ocean,\" while man-made objects have positive values, such as \"car,\" \"chair,\" and \"laptop.\""

  "content": "There are 6 dimensions.\n\nRow 1: 3D shape. The values for this dimension vary significantly across the labels, indicating that it encodes information about the three-dimensional shape of the objects.\nRow 2: Mobility. The values for this dimension are mostly positive, suggesting that it encodes information about the mobility or movement associated with the objects.\nRow 3: Edibility. The values for this dimension are a mix of positive and negative, but they are generally low, indicating that it encodes information about the edibility of the objects.\nRow 4: Size. The values for this dimension range from negative to positive, suggesting that it encodes information about the size or scale of the objects.\nRow 5: Consumer goods. The values for this dimension are mostly negative, indicating that it encodes information about whether the objects are commonly used consumer goods.\nRow 6: Natural vs. Man-made. The values for this dimension vary significantly across the labels, suggesting that it encodes information about whether the objects are natural or man-made."
