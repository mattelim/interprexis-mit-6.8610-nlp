The following is a list of lists, the first row contains words that have been put into DistilBERT. Each of the 5 subsequent rows contains the embedding value from DistilBERT for one dimension (out of 768) across the words. By comparing the values for each word for each row, I want you to interpret the likely concepts that each row, that is the dimension/axis of the embedding, encodes. Each of the 5 rows should encode a different concept. Please give me 2 unique possibilities of these 5 concepts.

Based on the given embedding values, here are two possibilities for the concepts that each row could encode:

Possibility 1:

Row 1: Mobility - The values seem to be higher for objects related to transportation (bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat).
Row 2: Edibility - The values are generally lower for inedible objects and higher for edible ones (banana, apple, sandwich, orange, broccoli, carrot, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake).
Row 3: Animacy - The values are generally lower for non-living objects and higher for living ones (person, bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe).
Row 4: Utility - The values seem to be higher for objects that are commonly used in daily life (bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, chair, couch, potted plant, bed, dining table, toilet, tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator, book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair drier, toothbrush).
Row 5: Visibility - The values seem to be higher for objects that are typically larger and more visible in a scene (traffic light, stop sign, parking meter, bench, suitcase, frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket).
Possibility 2:

Row 1: Size - The values seem to be higher for larger objects (car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat).
Row 2: Organic - The values seem to be higher for organic or living things (person, bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe, banana, apple, sandwich, orange, broccoli, carrot).
Row 3: Hardness - The values seem to be higher for harder objects (bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat, traffic light, stop sign, parking meter, bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator, clock, scissors).
Row 4: Domesticity - The values seem to be higher for objects typically found in a home setting (bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, chair, couch, potted plant, bed, dining table, toilet, tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator, book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair drier, toothbrush).
Row 5: Outdoor - The values seem to be higher for objects typically found outdoors (bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat, traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, bench, frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket).
